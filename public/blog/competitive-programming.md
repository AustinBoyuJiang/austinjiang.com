# Getting Into Competitive Programming

Competitive programming has become one of my favorite ways to improve my problem-solving skills and learn new algorithms.

## Why I Started

- **Problem-solving skills**: Each problem requires creative thinking
- **Algorithm knowledge**: Learning classic algorithms and data structures
- **Time pressure**: Improving coding speed and accuracy
- **Community**: Meeting other passionate programmers

## Platforms I Use

### Codeforces
My go-to platform for contests and practice problems. The rating system keeps me motivated to improve.

### LeetCode
Great for interview preparation and daily coding practice.

### AtCoder
Excellent problems with clear explanations and editorials.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start small**: Begin with easy problems and gradually increase difficulty
2. **Learn patterns**: Many problems follow similar algorithmic patterns
3. **Practice regularly**: Consistency is key to improvement
4. **Read editorials**: Learn from others' solutions
5. **Join contests**: Real-time problem solving under pressure

## My Progress

I've been steadily improving my rating and learning new concepts. The journey is challenging but incredibly rewarding!
