# My First Hackathon Experience

Participating in my first hackathon was both exciting and challenging. Here's what I learned from building a project in just 48 hours.

## The Challenge

Working under tight deadlines while collaborating with a team I'd just met was initially overwhelming, but it taught me valuable lessons about rapid prototyping and teamwork.

## What I Built

Our team created a web application that helps students find study groups. We used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Key Takeaways

- **Time management is crucial**: Planning and prioritizing features early saves time later
- **Communication is key**: Regular check-ins with team members prevent conflicts
- **MVP first**: Focus on core functionality before adding bells and whistles
- **Learn from others**: Watching other teams present gave me new ideas

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely! The experience was invaluable and I'm already looking forward to the next hackathon.
