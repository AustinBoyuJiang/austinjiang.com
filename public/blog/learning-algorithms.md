# Data Structures and Algorithms Journey

Understanding algorithms and data structures is fundamental to computer science. Here's my learning journey.

## Why Algorithms Matter

Algorithms are the building blocks of efficient software. They help us solve problems systematically and optimize performance.

## Key Data Structures I've Learned

### Arrays and Lists
The foundation of most other data structures.

### Trees and Graphs
Essential for hierarchical data and network problems.

### Hash Tables
Perfect for fast lookups and caching.

## Algorithm Categories

### Sorting Algorithms
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

### Search Algorithms
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search

### Dynamic Programming
Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems.

## Practice Platforms

I've been practicing on:
- LeetCode for interview preparation
- Codeforces for competitive programming
- HackerRank for skill assessment

## Next Steps

I'm planning to dive deeper into:
- Advanced graph algorithms
- String algorithms
- Computational geometry
