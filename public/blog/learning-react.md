# Learning React: My Experience

React has been one of the most exciting technologies I've learned recently. Building this personal website was a great way to practice.

## Key Concepts I Learned

### Components
React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable UI elements.

### State Management
Using hooks like useState and useEffect to manage component state and side effects.

### Styling
Combining CSS with React components to create beautiful, responsive designs.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was understanding the React lifecycle and when to use different hooks. But with practice, it's becoming more intuitive.

## Next Steps

I'm planning to learn:
- Next.js for server-side rendering
- TypeScript for better type safety
- More advanced state management with Redux
